## System Configuration

âœ… **Backend Server**: Configured for `192.168.254.107:3000`
âœ… **Mobile App**: Will connect to backend automatically
âœ… **Website**: Connected to backend API
âœ… **Dependencies**: All packages installed and working
âœ… **Android Build**: Successful

## To Start the System

1. **Start Backend Server** (Terminal 1):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open Website** (Browser):
   - Open `website/index.html` in your browser
   - Or serve it: `cd website && python -m http.server 8000`

3. **Run Mobile App**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   flutter run
   ```
   Or install the APK manually on your device

## Testing the System

1. Open the mobile app - it will request notification permissions
2. Check the website - should show "1 Registered Device"
3. Send a test notification from the website
4. You should receive it on the mobile app!

## Troubleshooting

- **No devices showing on website**: Make sure mobile app is open and has internet
- **Can't connect to backend**: Check IP address (192.168.254.107) and ensure phone/computer are on same WiFi
- **Notifications not working**: Verify Firebase setup is complete

## Next Steps

1. Complete Firebase setup:
   - Add `google-services.json` to `mobile-app/android/app/`
   - Add `serviceAccountKey.json` to `backend/`
   - Update `mobile-app/lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase project details

2. Test the full system end-to-end

3. Build release APK for distribution:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

**Everything is ready! Just start the backend server and test!** ðŸš€
